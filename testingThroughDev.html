            <p class="parContent">
                A software development lifecycle model describes the types of activity performed at each stage in a 
                software development project, and how the activities relate to one another logically and chronologically. 
                There are a number of different software development lifecycle models, each of which requires different 
                approaches to testing. </p>
                <p class="parContent">It is an important part of a tester's role to be familiar with the common software development lifecycle
                    models so that appropriate test activities can take place.</p>
                    
                <li>For every development activity, there is a corresponding test activity</li>
                <li>Each test level has test objectives specific to that level</li>
                <li>Test analysis and design for a given test level begin during the corresponding development activity</li>
                <li>Testers participate in discussions to define and refine requirements and design, and are involved 
                    in reviewing work products (e.g., requirements, design, user stories, etc.) as soon as drafts are 
                    available </li>
                <p class="parContent">A sequential development model describes the software development process as a linear, sequential flow 
                    of activities. This means that any phase in the development process should begin when the previous 
                    phase is complete. In theory, there is no overlap of phases, but in practice, it is beneficial to have early 
                    feedback from the following phase.
                    In the Waterfall model, the development activities (e.g., requirements analysis, design, coding, testing) 
                    are completed one after another. In this model, test activities only occur after all other development 
                    activities have been completed. 
                    Unlike the Waterfall model, the V-model integrates the test process throughout the development process, 
                    implementing the principle of early testing. Further, the V-model includes test levels associated with each 
                    corresponding development phase, which further supports early testing (see section 2.2 for a discussion 
                    of test levels). In this model, the execution of tests associated with each test level proceeds sequentially, 
                    but in some cases overlapping occurs</p>

            <h2 class="parTitle">Test Levels</h2>
            <p class="parContent">
                Test levels are groups of test activities that are organized and managed together. Each test level is an 
                instance of the test process, consisting of the activities described in section 1.4, performed in relation to 
                software at a given level of development, from individual units or components to complete systems or, 
                where applicable, systems of systems. Test levels are related to other activities within the software 
                development lifecycle. The test levels used in this syllabus are:</p>
                <li>Component testing</li>
                <li>Integration testing</li>
                <li>System testing</li>
                <li>Acceptance testing</li>
                <p class="parContent">In iterative development, project teams can employ various forms of acceptance testing during and at the 
                    end of each iteration, such as those focused on verifying a new feature against its acceptance criteria and 
                    those focused on validating that a new feature satisfies the usersâ€™ needs. In addition, alpha tests and beta 
                    tests may occur, either at the end of each iteration, after the completion of each iteration, or after a series 
                    of iterations. User acceptance tests, operational acceptance tests, regulatory acceptance tests, and 
                    contractual acceptance tests also may occur, either at the close of each iteration, after the completion of 
                    each iteration, or after a series of iterations.</p>

            <h2 class="parTitle">Test Types</h2>
            <p class="parContent">
                A test type is a group of test activities aimed at testing specific characteristics of a software system, or a 
                part of a system, based on specific test objectives. Such objectives may include:
            </p>
            <li>Evaluating functional quality characteristics, such as completeness, correctness, and 
                appropriateness</li>
            <li>Evaluating non-functional quality characteristics, such as reliability, performance efficiency, 
                security, compatibility, and usability</li>
            <li>Evaluating whether the structure or architecture of the component or system is correct, complete, 
                and as specified </li>
            <li>Evaluating the effects of changes, such as confirming that defects have been fixed (confirmation 
                testing) and looking for unintended changes in behavior resulting from software or environment 
                changes (regression testing)</li>
            <p class="parContent">Confirmation testing and regression testing are performed at all test levels.
                Especially in iterative and incremental development lifecycles (e.g., Agile), new features, changes to 
                existing features, and code refactoring result in frequent changes to the code, which also requires 
                change-related testing. Due to the evolving nature of the system, confirmation and regression testing are 
                very important. This is particularly relevant for Internet of Things systems where individual objects (e.g., 
                devices) are frequently updated or replaced. 
                Regression test suites are run many times and generally evolve slowly, so regression testing is a strong 
                candidate for automation. Automation of these tests should start early in the project</p>

            <h2 class="parTitle">Maintenance Testing</h2>
            <p class="parContent">
                Once deployed to production environments, software and systems need to be maintained. Changes of 
                various sorts are almost inevitable in delivered software and systems, either to fix defects discovered in 
                operational use, to add new functionality, or to delete or alter already-delivered functionality. Maintenance 
                is also needed to preserve or improve non-functional quality characteristics of the component or systemover its lifetime, especially performance efficiency, compatibility, reliability, security, , and portability. 
                When any changes are made as part of maintenance, maintenance testing should be performed, both to 
                evaluate the success with which the changes were made and to check for possible side-effects (e.g., 
                regressions) in parts of the system that remain unchanged (which is usually most of the system). 
                Maintenance can involve planned releases and unplanned releases (hot fixes). 
                A maintenance release may require maintenance testing at multiple test levels, using various test types, 
                based on its scope. The scope of maintenance testing depends on:
            </p>
            <li>The degree of risk of the change, for example, the degree to which the changed area of software 
                communicates with other components or systems</li>
            <li>The size of the existing system</li>
            <li>The size of the change</li>
