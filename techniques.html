            <h2 class="parTitle">What is Testing?</h2>
            <p class="parContent">
                A number of testing principles have been suggested over the past 50 years and offer general guidelines 
                common for all testing.
                    1. Testing shows the presence of defects, not their absence
                Testing can show that defects are present, but cannot prove that there are no defects. Testing reduces 
                the probability of undiscovered defects remaining in the software but, even if no defects are found, testing 
                is not a proof of correctness. 
                2. Exhaustive testing is impossible
                Testing everything (all combinations of inputs and preconditions) is not feasible except for trivial cases. 
                Rather than attempting to test exhaustively, risk analysis, test techniques, and priorities should be used to 
                focus test efforts. 
                3. Early testing saves time and money
                To find defects early, both static and dynamic test activities should be started as early as possible in the 
                software development lifecycle. Early testing is sometimes referred to as shift left. Testing early in the 
                software development lifecycle helps reduce or eliminate costly changes (see section 3.1).
                4. Defects cluster together
                A small number of modules usually contains most of the defects discovered during pre-release testing, or 
                is responsible for most of the operational failures. Predicted defect clusters, and the actual observed 
                defect clusters in test or operation, are an important input into a risk analysis used to focus the test effort 
                (as mentioned in principle 2).

            <h2 class="parTitle">Why is Testing Necessary?</h2>
            <p class="parContent">
                Software systems are an integral part of life, from business applications (e.g., banking) to consumer 
                products (e.g., cars). Most people have had an experience with software that did not work as expected. 
                Software that does not work correctly can lead to many problems, including loss of money, time, or 
                business reputation, and even injury or death. Software testing is a way to assess the quality of the 
                software and to reduce the risk of software failure in operation.
                A common misperception of testing is that it only consists of running tests, i.e., executing the software 
                and checking the results. As described in section 1.4, software testing is a process which includes many 
                different activities; test execution (including checking of results) is only one of these activities. The test 
                process also includes activities such as test planning, analyzing, designing, and implementing tests, 
                reporting test progress and results, and evaluating the quality of a test object. 
                Some testing does involve the execution of the component or system being tested; such testing is called 
                dynamic testing. Other testing does not involve the execution of the component or system being tested; 
                such testing is called static testing. So, testing also includes reviewing work products such as 
                requirements, user stories, and source code. 
                Another common misperception of testing is that it focuses entirely on verification of requirements, user 
                stories, or other specifications. While testing does involve checking whether the system meets specified 
                requirements, it also involves validation, which is checking whether the system will meet user and other 
                stakeholder needs in its operational environment(s).

            <h2 class="parTitle">Seven Testing Principles</h2>
            <p class="parContent">
            Rigorous testing of components and systems, and their associated documentation, can help reduce the 
                    risk of failures occurring during operation. When defects are detected, and subsequently fixed, this 
                contributes to the quality of the components or systems. In addition, software testing may also be 
                    required to meet contractual or legal requirements or industry-specific standards.
                    Throughout the history of computing, it is quite common for software and systems to be delivered into 
    operation and, due to the presence of defects, to subsequently cause failures or otherwise not meet the 
    stakeholders’ needs. However, using appropriate test techniques can reduce the frequency of such 
    problematic deliveries, when those techniques are applied with the appropriate level of test expertise, in 
    the appropriate test levels, and at the appropriate points in the software development lifecycle. Examples 
    include:

            <h2 class="parTitle">Test Process</h2>
            <p class="parContent">
                There is no one universal software test process, but there are common sets of test activities without which 
            testing will be less likely to achieve its established objectives. These sets of test activities are a test 
            process. The proper, specific software test process in any given situation depends on many factors. 
            Which test activities are involved in this test process, how these activities are implemented, and when 
            these activities occur may be discussed in an organization’s test strategy It is very useful if the test basis (for any level or type of testing that is being considered) has measurable 
            coverage criteria defined. The coverage criteria can act effectively as key performance indicators (KPIs) 
            to drive the activities that demonstrate achievement of software test objectives (see section 1.1.1).

            <h2 class="parTitle">The Psychology of Testing</h2>
            <p class="parContent">
                Identifying defects during a static test such as a requirement review or user story refinement session, or 
                identifying failures during dynamic test execution, may be perceived as criticism of the product and of its 
                author. An element of human psychology called confirmation bias can make it difficult to accept 
                information that disagrees with currently held beliefs. For example, since developers expect their code to 
                be correct, they have a confirmation bias that makes it difficult to accept that the code is incorrect. In 
                addition to confirmation bias, other cognitive biases may make it difficult for people to understand or 
                accept information produced by testing. Further, it is a common human trait to blame the bearer of bad 
                news, and information produced by testing often contains bad news.
                As a result of these psychological factors, some people may perceive testing as a destructive activity, 
                even though it contributes greatly to project progress and product quality (see sections 1.1 and 1.2). To 
                try to reduce these perceptions, information about defects and failures should be communicated in a 
                constructive way. This way, tensions between the testers and the analysts, product owners, designers, 
                and developers can be reduced. This applies during both static and dynamic testing.
                Testers and test managers need to have good interpersonal skills to be able to communicate effectively 
                about defects, failures, test results, test progress, and risks, and to build positive relationships with 
                colleagues. Ways to communicate well include the following examples:
                • Start with collaboration rather than battles. Remind everyone of the common go
